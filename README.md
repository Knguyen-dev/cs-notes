# CS-Programming-Notes

Acts as a vault of notes, which will be used as reference later. However I found that some topics, mainly topics that span an entire course, are sometimes better suited being in Google Doc format. I'll list these here [online notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wpY9lmAtmPu010oqliV8nNVjPq-IEube?usp=sharing)

## General Structure
### Distributed Systems
Anything related to distributed systems and large scale system design.

- System design principles
- Scalability patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, load balancing)
- Tools (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- CAP theorem, consensus algorithms, leader election

---
### Data Structures & Algorithms
Anything related to DSA theory.
- Complexity analysis
- Specific algorithms (sorting, searching, graph, etc.)
- Specific data structures (hashmap, queues, red-black trees)

---
### Security
Anything related to security of application
- Authentication & authorization (OAuth, OIDC, CILogon)
- Encryption basics (symmetric, asymmetric)
- Network security (TLS, HTTPS, SSH, etc.)
- Common vulnerabilities (OWASP)

---

### Networking
Basic computer networking concepts.
- TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, ICMP
- SSH, SFTP, VPNs
- WebSockets, gRPC
- Protocol deep-dives

---
### Programming & Tooling
Related to notes about a programming or scripting language, or taking notes of a framework or tool that I'm using so that I can reference it later. There would be **subfolders** for each:
* **Languages**
  * Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL/Postgres, MongoDB, C, etc.
* **Frameworks & Libraries**
  * Django, Spring, React, Express, etc.
* **Tooling**
  * Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, Git, Makefiles, build tools
* **Web Development**
  * HTML, CSS, HTTP basics, REST, GraphQL
---

### Systems & OS Concepts

* Concurrency (threading, asyncio, WSGI vs ASGI, daemon threads)
* Processes vs threads
* Scheduling
* Memory management
* Filesystems

---
###  Miscellaneous / Deep Dives
Catch-all for quirkly one, off writeups that don't really fit elsewhere.
- Character encodings (Unicode, UTF-8)
- CORS
- Database migrations
- Connection pools
- What are web servers?
