# Linux notes



## What is Unix and Linux? How are they related?
Unix is an old and powerful operating system created in the 1960s at AT&T's Bell labs. It allows multi-user and multitasking. It has become the foundation for many later operating systems such as Linux. 

Now Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system. Whilst 'Unix' was originally proprietary, meaning it was owned and used by specific companies, Linux on the other hand is open-source and free to use. Here's a break-down of Linux:
1. Kernel-based: Linux refers to the kernel, which is the core part of the operating system that manages hardware and system resources. However, in common usage, "Linux" often refres to the entire operating system built around the Linux kernel, which includes other software.
2. Open Source: Unlike Unix, Linux is open source, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
3. Unix-like: Similar to Uni, as it copies its design principles.
4. Distributions: Comes in various distributions/variants (distros) such as Ubuntu, Fedora, centOS, Debian, etc. Each of these distributions of Linux are tailored for different use cases and user preferences.
5. Wide adoption: Linux is widely used in servers, supercomputers, embedded systems, and as a desktop OS, particularly for developers and technical users such as system admins. 

## Architecture of a Unix system:
- Kernel: The core software of the operating system that interacts with the hardware and manages system resources. 
- Shell: The software that processes your commands, and converts them into a language that can be understood by the kernel. You type in your commands via the shell, which is the terminal or CLI. There are different types of shells, and one of the more popular ones is 'Bash'.
- Commands and Utilities: Things such as copying files, moving files, 'grep', and various other standard or builtin commands.
- Files and Directories: Files are organized into 'directories' in a tree-like structure.


## What is Unix/Linux Scripting
To communicate with the operating system (the kernel) users write 'scripts' or commands to automate tasks in a Unix or Linux environment. You input these commands via the shell, which is the CLI for these types of systems. However you can also put these commands into a file, and run those files to quickly launch commands in an easy way. The latter is a lot more powerful, and this is the idea of shell scripting  These scripts are commonly written in a shell  language called 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell). 


## How this will work
First, study the basics of Linux. Get to know what Linux is, the basic Linux commands, and honestly get comfortable with using Linux. Then learn about Bash scripting once you've gotten down the Linux fundamentals.
