Notes about logging in python and how to use it


Purpose of Logging: Logging allows you to record the progress and state of your program. Basically makes it easier to keep
    track of how thigns are working, such as variable values, behavior, etc. which will in turn make it easier for you and other people
    to debug and make changes.

Levels of Logging: There are five levels of logging, you can create more, but these five should suffice usually. Each of these 
    levels has a value, and the importance of that will be explained later in 'Basics'


1. Debug: 10
2. Info: 20
3. Warning: 30
4. Error: 40
5. Critical: 50
