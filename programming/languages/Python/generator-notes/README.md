- Notes about python's unique iterator generators

- Generators don't hold everything in memory,       they're an iterator which makes them more efficient than lists in that case. As well as being space efficient, they are faster in performance speed

- Things to note about generators:
1. You can't make a copy of a generator
2. You can't reset a generator so that it's back to some position or state.
3. They can be way more space and time efficient than lists
