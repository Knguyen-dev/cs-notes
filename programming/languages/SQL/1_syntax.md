# Syntax
SQL has keywords like "SELECT", which can be in any casing to work. So common ones are "SELECT" "WHERE" and "FROM". Ending a command in a semi-colon is required, it signals the end of the statement. 

- SeLect * FROM table;

It's standard to write all keywords in full uppercase
- SELECT * FROM Table

To write a string in sql, use single quotes and put the string inside of it.

- 'myString'
