  If you go over the allowed limit, it's considered an overflow, and it will reset your variable's value to the lowest 
  possible value. For example if I go to '256', then it will set the value of g to 0.  For 'h' if I go 
  over +32767, then it'll set me back to -32,768.

  - The reason we have to do 'long' twice is that by default 'int' are already implicitly long. So if we want to store a really
  large number we declare it like this. The former is -9 to +9 quintillion whilst the latter is 0 to +18 quintillion.
