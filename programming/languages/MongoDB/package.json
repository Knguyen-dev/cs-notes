Each collection is in charge of storing its own\r   respective data.\r - Documents: A document represents a record in the database. For example\r   a single document in the 'Users' collection would contain information about\r   an individual user. The data for the user would be formatted in a structure\r   similar to a JSON object, just a key-value pair. Every document has a\r   unique id, similar to primary keys in sql, that are created by MongoDB itself.",
