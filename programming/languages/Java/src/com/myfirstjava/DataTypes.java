/*
 * + Primitives vs Reference Data Types:
 *
 * - Primitives: These are your simple data types. When you do assignment with these data types we are assigning the value.
 * Here are the list of data types:
 * 1. byte (1 byte): [-128, 127]
 * 2. short (2 bytes): [-32,768 to 32,767]
 * 3. int (4 bytes): [-2B, 2B]
 * 4. long (8 bytes)
 * 5. float (4 bytes): [3.4eâˆ’038 to 3.4e+038]; Has a precision of 7 decimal digits. You can think of it as, we can accurately represent
 * the decimal value up to a point. But after those 7 decimal digits, there is some loss in precision and confidence due to it being a floating point.
 * For example, the in float `3.14159265358979323846`, the first 7 decimal digits (`3.1415927`) will be accurately represented, but anything beyond that
 * may not be accurately stored.
 * 6. double (8 bytes): Has a precision of 15 decimal digits.
 * 7. char (2 bytes): A, B, C...; represents unicode characters, and supports international letters.
 * 8. boolean (1 byte): true/false
 * Stuff like byte, short, int, and long can only represent integers. So the 'bytes' they take, is just the amount of memory
 * that's allocated (used) to store that variable. So if a function has 4 integers, that's about 16 bytes of memory being taken
 * up whilst the function is running or when the variables are in scope. Then that memory is reclaimed when the function ends
 * as we don't need that stuff anymore.
 *
 * - Reference Types: These are complex objects. When we do assignment with a reference type
 * you aren't assigning the value of the object, but a reference (memory address) that points to said
 * object.
 *
 * - Differences:
 * 1. Origin: Primitive types are innately defined in Java, they already exist in teh language itself. Whilst
 * non-primitives, some exist innately, but others can be user defined. I mean you as a developer don't define
 * the 'int' datatype, but you may define 'User'.
 *
 * 2. Value Storage: Primitives hold a single value whilst non-primitives cna hold many and
 * do complex things with them.
 *
 * 3. Memory allocation: Primitive types are allocated memory on the stack, whilst with reference types
 * they only put a reference of themselves on the stack whilst hte actual object resides in heap memory.
