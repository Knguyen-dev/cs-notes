# Auditing and verifying accessibility
Now knowing the things to make websites accessible, how we can quickly check which parts of our site aren't accessible? We'll use software to do that and make our development lives easier.


## Accessibility Devtools
Using devtools is helpful for doing a quick audit. You can check contrast ratios, accessibility properties, view the tree, and do much more.

## Accessibility auditing 
There are plenty of third party tools we can use.


- [axe devtools for chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US): Extension that returns a list of issues ranked by severity levels.
- [Chrome Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse): Popular chrome software that you can use to audit various webpages. Things such as performance, SEO, and it also has a feature to audit accessibility! It's built into chrome dev tools, but you can also use it in other ways.
- [WebAIM's WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/): Website based tool where you enter the url of the page you want to audit. There are of course other ways, but this is the main one. More importantly, wave will return a preview page with icons over it, and the issues are separated into things such as alerts, warnings, and contrast errors. 

One of the best ways to check the accessibility of your site is to check the feedback from users who rely on these accessibility features.
