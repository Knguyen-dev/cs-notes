/*
- Goal/Situation: We want to make it so as we scroll, the 'A' header stays at the top of the list, until
  we get to the 'B' header, and the B header stay sticky until we get to the 'C' header, and so on.
*/

/*
- Solution 1: The way to do this is to apply position sticky and top: 0 to the list header. As a result 
  as soon as the list header is 0 pixels away from the top of its parent container (list-group), then 
  it becomes position sticky.

- NOTE: The reason the previous list header stops becoming sticky once it hits the next header is because
  a sticky element can only be in that 'fixed' position whilst inside it's parent container. Once we reach 
  the bottom of the parent container, it not longer becomes fixed.
*/

/* .list-header {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
} */

/*
+ Browser Compatibility: Not all browsers and versions support position sticky. So to increase 
  support you may see us put many prefixes like below
*/
/* .list-header {
    position: -webkit-sticky;
    position: -moz-sticky;
    position: -ms-sticky;
    position: -o-sticky;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
} */

/*
- Solution 2: This is a common approach to ensure support for sticky property. Here we use the '@supports' rule 
  which checks if a browser supports a certain CSS property or property-value pair. 

  1. If browser supports position sticky, our list-header will be position sticky with top: 0.
  2. Else, our list-header will stay position relative.

  Doing this helps maintain consistent behavior across different browsers.
