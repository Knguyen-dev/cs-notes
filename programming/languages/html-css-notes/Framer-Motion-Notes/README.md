# Framer Motion Intro

## App setup
The different pages are rendered inside App.js (root component), which makes sense. The routing to different pages is done in a specific sequential order. It goes home => base (for base pizza ingredients) => toppings (for pizza toppings) => order (for confirming the pizza order).

Our Header is apart of App, so it'll always be rendered regardless of what route we are on. We have an 'index.html' inside 'public' which is essentially the 
file we are using to serve our the UI of our app on.

We have some fonts 'Quicksand-Light' which are used in our index.css to enable the font.

## What is Framer Motion?
An animation library for react. Allows us to apply simple to complex animations to our DOM elements. And we can do this with very simple and clean lines of code as well. So we'll do a project for this
