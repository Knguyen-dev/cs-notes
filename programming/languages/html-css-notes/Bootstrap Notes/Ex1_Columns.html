        <!-- 
            

            - row & columns: Rows use flexbox which is why the columns are 
            always evenly spaced. We do "col-x" to make a column
            span x columns. For example, doing 'col-6' makes a div
            span 6 columns, whilst the take up the remaining space.

            NOTE: 
            1. Even doing 'col-10' and you have 3 other columns. Bootstrap
                won't add additional columns to evenly distribute to the others.
                The other columns will just cleanly and evenly span whatever's left.
            2. If you have columns 8 and 5, then since it goes over 12 column limit, 
                the latter column is going to be pushed to the next flexbox row. So 
                remmeber to count your columns to know what's happening

            3. Since we just put 'container', it would snap into a fixed width on anything
                on small and above screens. For extra small, it just takes 100% of the width

            Ex2: Doing "col-lg-4" would make it so on lg and above, 
                it only spans 4 columns, and for screens smaller. Note
                that in this case if you specified 'col-size-x', on
                screens that aren't covered it will defaults to taking 100% width 
                so all 12 columns. So to avoid that, you'll want to make sure 
                you're sizing things to cover all other screen sizes.

                2. Then we just have a column that spans 4 in all cases.

                NOTE: Here we're able to change how columns span in our 
                    grid layout based on the size of the screen.

                - offset-x: Makes it seem like there's an x column space in 
                    to the left of a column. This actually does use up
                    x columns in the row, but it's an easy way to push
                    columns over if you need.
                1. Takes 4 columns and has one-column space taken 
                2. Takes up 4 columns but has a 3-columned space taken.
                    In total, all twelve columns are taken.
                
                note: Of course you can indicate a size as well, with 
                    offset-size-x when you want column spaces to appear 
                    on certain screen sizes.
