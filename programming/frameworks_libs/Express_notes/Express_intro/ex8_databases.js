/*
+ Using databases in Express: 
- Express apps can use any database supported by Node. so you
  can have PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.
  You just have to install the database driver for your specific 
  database using npm. Your database itself can be locally stored,
  or it can be stored on the cloud, so there's no restriction here.
