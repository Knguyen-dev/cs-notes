+ Create a virtual property for the book instance's url

- NOTE: Another good use for virtual properties, as you're not going to store 
  a 'path' property in the database. By using Mongoose and virtual properties, 
  it makes it easy to create a route for your model objects, and if you want to change
  the route to something different, it's easy to change.

+ Create a virtual property for the book's formatted date:

1. DateTime.fromJSDate(): Used to create a Luxon DateTime object 
  from a JavaScript Date object. 

2. .toLocaleString(preset): Turns a Luxon date time object, into a 
  human readable string that shows the date. By default it 
  shows "4/20/2017", but you can pass a preset. Here we pass 
  DateTime.DATE_MED, which we see abbreviates the date to 
  'April 20, 2017".

1. https://github.com/moment/luxon/blob/master/docs/formatting.md
