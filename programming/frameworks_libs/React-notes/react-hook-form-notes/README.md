# React + Vite

- React Hook Form: Library for managing form state and validation in react.
  Create flexible forms without making boiler plate code. It's a small library
  that's also optimized for performance by reducing re-renders.
- Yup: JavaScript schema builder for validation. Typically used with 
  form libraries to define validation rules for form fields.

# Project setup:
1. npm i react-hook-form yup; install form library and validation library
2. npm i @hookform/resolvers; Helps with integrating react-hook-form and yup
