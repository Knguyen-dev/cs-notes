# Higher-Order-Components in React
A higher order component is a function, that returns an inner function and
the inner function returns a component. The idea is similar to Python decorators
where you wrap an 'inner component' aroudn an outer component. As a result you'd 
be able to get access to the state values from an outer component. Then you'd be 
able to use the HOC with high reusability, just wrapping around other components 
and giving them extra functionality as needed.
