# Auth and Private/Protected Routes with React

-   Here is a very simple example of how to deal with protected routing and
    auth in react-router-dom. Of course this example could have a form with
    username and password, and a login page, but with this, I think it'll
    be good notes to take note of in the future.

-   Note: As we mentioned before in React_Router_Notes section, this type of
    routing is icing on the cake. To have actual security, you have to secure
    your data and site on the backend.

-   Credits: https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-router-authentication/; This person made it really simple to follow, and had good insight when talking about how using real world auth api and how some things would differ with our mock.
