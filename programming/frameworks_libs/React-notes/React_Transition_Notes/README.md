# What is React Transition Group

-   RTG library uses a CSSTransition component. Then it helps
    us apply transitions to the enter and exit state of a component.
    We we're mainly animating the mounting and dismounting of a component, which is typically what we need in React most of the time.

# How does it work

1. Changes the state from enter to exit on the CSSTransition
   component.
2. Based on state, it applies css classes to the child component
3. Then we create css selectors from those classes, which is where
   we're able to create our css rules and statements.

# Setting up React Transition Group

1. npm install react-transition-group
